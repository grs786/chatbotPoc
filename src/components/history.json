      "output": "The vehicle noise issue can be addressed by identifying the specific type of noise and its source. For example, if the noise is a pop/clunk/ snap from the rear of a 2021 F-150 (non-Raptor/non-Tremor) when driving up/ down an incline, it may be due to movement between the rear spring and the rear spring mounting plate on the rear axle. The solution involves applying lubrication between these surfaces as per **TSB 22-2283** <sup>[1]</sup>. \n\nIf the noise is a clicking/scraping sound from under a 2021 F-150, it might be due to a detached heat shield. The solution involves repairing the heat shield(s) according to **TSB 21-2296** <sup>[8]</sup>.\n\nFor a grinding/ hum/rumble noise from the front wheel area in a 2021-2024 F-150 non-Raptor with 4WD and ESOF, the issue may be due to incomplete disengagement of the IWE actuator assemblies. The solution is to replace these assemblies as per **TSB 24-2189** <sup>[5]</sup>.\n\nIf the noise is a rattle/scraping from the bellhousing area on start-up in a 2021-2024 F-150 with a 3.5L EcoBoost engine, it may be due to the torque converter studs contacting the engine-to- transmission spacer plate.
